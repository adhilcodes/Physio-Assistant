# Physio-Assistant

**Submission for Ingress Hackathon**

GETFIT is a web app made with tensorflow.js to enable accessible physiotherapy for people exercises by responding to users' postures in real-time.

TF.js API [link](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/HLNT_5O0Y/)

## Technology

 - ### Machine Learning - tensorflow.js

GETFIT uses a tensorflow.js model to make predictions on the state of the current user's pose. It has been trained on a dataset of images created by us (~500 images per pose) to predict whether the position is correct, or incorrect. We have used Google Teachable Machine to train our models in the various physiotherapy poses.  

 - ### Index.html
The index.html contains all the HTML that forms the backbone of the website.
We have used the bootstrap open-source CSS framework for our front-end development.
